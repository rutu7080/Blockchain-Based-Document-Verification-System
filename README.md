# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
```
Start hardhat node
```shell
npx hardhat node
```
In another Terminal Deploy Contract
```shell
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
In another Terminal Start frontend App
```shell
cd frontend
cd src
npm start
```
